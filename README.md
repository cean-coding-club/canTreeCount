## Remember the workflow:
1. Consider pulling from the github repo before making changes (pull button on Git tab)
2. Always create a new branch (top right of Git tab) to make edits
3. Save edits, select items to commit, and commit with a useful simple comment
4. Push the edited branch to the Github repo
5. Make a pull request on Github website
6. Someone will review and accept the changes, and merge the edited branch into the main branch
